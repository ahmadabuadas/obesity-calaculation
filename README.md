## Obesity Calaculation

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the body mass index (BMI) is a tool measuring overweight and obesity. Taking weight and height into account, it represents different levels of health risks.

BMI (kg/m2) is calculated by dividing a personâ€™s weight in kilograms by height in meter squared. BMI cut-points of 25 and 30 are used to classify adults as overweight or obese.
